# Destination Unknown

Destination Unknown is a game where you compete against each other in guessing the destination based on songs you hear. The songs are arranged so that it starts out hard and then gets easier for each song. As one could guess, more points are given for the songs in the beginning, than those in the end. 

Where are we going? We don't know!
